# Hackathon Web App

A full-stack web application developed in 48 hours during my first hackathon. This project was built by a team of four women of color, and I led the architecture, UI layout, and live demo delivery.

## Project Overview

This web app was designed and developed under tight time constraints to showcase team collaboration, backend system design, and interface responsiveness.

## Features
- **Full-stack implementation** using Java (backend) and HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend)
- **User authentication**, **form handling**, and **dynamic content display**
- RESTful routing and server-side logic handled in Java
- Fully functional UI with interactive features for users
- Responsive layout compatible with desktop and mobile

## Technologies Used
- **Java** – Server-side logic and backend functionality
- **HTML & CSS** – Page structure and styling
- **JavaScript** – Client-side interactivity

## My Role
- Architected the app’s backend logic and request flow
- Designed and implemented the user interface layout
- Led the team’s demo presentation to judges
- Helped integrate frontend and backend under time pressure
